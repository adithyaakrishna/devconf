						<p>A talk is where you present with slides and demos to an audience. A talk is 25 minutes long (We know from past conferences and virtual events that attention and audience drops the most after 25 minutes). We recommend reserving some time at the end for Q&A, e.g. 20-minute talk and 5-minute Q&A. If speakers wish to continue with the Q&A after their time slot, there will be a dedicated place for it. Feel free to recruit your colleagues to interact with people in chat while you are talking. A talk has one primary speaker, optionally another (secondary) speaker.</p><p>A talk should be bite-sized and focused on a certain topic. This means that you should not expect to be able to cover multiple broad areas in one talk. You can submit more than one proposal, to cover a set of topics, but we cannot guarantee their final scheduled order. Therefore, we recommend topics be independent so that they do not need to be presented in a specific order.</p><p>We give speakers a choice to speak in-person or virtually - live (preferred) or pre-recorded. Consider what would work best for your session goals and availability.</p><p>We plan to stream in-person talks online and screen virtual talks at the venue.</p>

						<p>A discussion is where you lead/moderate a conversation with a group of knowledgeable panelists who answer prepared questions or questions from the audience as selected by you for appropriateness to your topic and session goal. It is an interactive session and you’re asked to engage with the audience during the session. If you are willing to open the discussion to attendees, consider holding a fishbowl discussion where you start with a group of speakers and an empty “seat” which could be filled by active audience members in the course of a discussion.</p><p>A discussion is 50 minutes long. If speakers wish to continue after their slot, there will be a dedicated place for it.

						<p>A workshop is a hands-on demo where you and other workshop leads interact among each other and with audience members on chat, sharing your knowledge and experience on a particular bite-sized topic. The goal of a workshop is to teach or practice a skill. You should not expect the audience following each step of the workshop live, however, they should have all necessary instructions if they wish to. As a result workshops should be actionable and goal oriented.</p><p>A workshop is 60 minutes long, although we will consider exceptions. We allow up to 3 active presenters in a workshop. You must designate one of them to be the primary session leader. We give in-person workshop leads a choice to decide whether they want to stream the content online. If yes, it is up to you to cover both channels. It is recommended to recruit your colleagues to interact with people in chat while you are talking.</p><p>All workshops are conducted live. We do not accept pre-recorded workshops. However, you may find it useful to pre-record demo components of your workshop.</p>

We have a <a href='/cz/speakerguide/' target='_blank'>speaker guide</a> and a <a href='/cz/speakercoachingguide' target='_blank'>speaker coaching guide</a> available to support speakers and coaches. People who sign up, will receive their coaching matches by December 15, with the expectation that they will schedule practice sessions between January 3 and January 21.<br><br>We ask the coaches to take the lead on scheduling the practice session via a video conference (BlueJeans, Talky.io, Jitsi Meet, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype, etc). The speaker can choose to invite other audience members to the practice. In the practice session, the speaker delivers their practice talk, and the coach and other audience members provide feedback on the talk and slide deck.<br><br>Speakers and coaches agree to abide by the <a href='/coc/' target='_blank'>DevConf Code of Conduct</a> both during the conference and in any pre-conference coaching, practice, or other program related activities.</p>

						<p>Yes! When you register for the event, you will be asked whether you would like to be a coach or an apprentice and what topics you have experience in or are interested in. Coaches and apprentices will then receive their matches via email. We always get a lot of interest from people to be coached, and encourage people who have attended more than ten technology conferences to sign up as coaches. If you have attended fewer than three technology conferences, please consider signing up as an apprentice.</p>
